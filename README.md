## 🧠 How It Works

1. User clicks the microphone button.
2. Browser captures voice input using SpeechRecognition API.
3. The command is processed using:
   - Knowledge base object
   - Greeting array detection
   - Mood object mapping
   - Website command object
4. The assistant responds using SpeechSynthesis API with a detected male voice (if available).
5. Some commands open websites or perform actions dynamically.
